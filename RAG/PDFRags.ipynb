            "### What is SQL?\n",
            "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language designed for managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It allows you to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a structured manner.\n",
            "\n",
            "### What is a Database?\n",
            "A database is a structured collection of data stored electronically that can be easily accessed, managed, and modified. Databases are central to a wide range of applications, including e-commerce platforms, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Types of SQL Commands\n",
            "SQL commands can be categorized into several types:\n",
            "1. **Data Query Language (DQL)**: These are used to read data from a database. Examples include `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, and `DISTINCT`.\n",
            "2. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: These are used to create, alter, and drop database structures like tables, indexes, and views. Examples include `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `DROP TABLE`.\n",
            "3. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: These are used to insert, update, and delete data within the database. Examples include `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.\n",
            "4. **Data Control Language (DCL)**: These are used to define access permissions for different users. An example is `GRANT`.\n",
            "5. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**: These are used to control transactions in the database. Examples include `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.\n",
            "6. **Data Query Language (DQL)** - Used to retrieve data from a database.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Basic Level (Beginner)\n",
            "#### 1. What is Primary Key?\n",
            "A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. No two rows can have the same primary key value, and it cannot accept NULL values.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 2. What is Foreign Key?\n",
            "A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table—that is, the data in this column matches the primary key in the referenced table.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 3. What is UNIQUE Key?\n",
            "A unique key is similar to a primary key but allows for NULL values and can have duplicate values if they are different within the same table. A table cannot have more than one unique key.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 4. The difference between Primary Key and UNIQUE Key\n",
            "- **Primary Key**: Must be unique, non-nullable, and every row must have a value (not allow NULL).\n",
            "- **UNIQUE Key**: Must be unique for each row but can accept up to one NULL value if the column allows it. There cannot be more than one unique key in a table.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 5. NOT NULL constraint\n",
            "The `NOT NULL` constraint specifies that a particular column cannot accept NULL values. All rows in the table must have a value for columns defined with `NOT NULL`.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 6. Default Constraint\n",
            "A default constraint specifies a default value for a column. If no value is specified for the column, the default value will be automatically inserted into the column when a new row is created.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 7. The difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP\n",
            "- **DELETE**: Removes records from a table but keeps the table structure intact.\n",
            "- **TRUNCATE**: Also removes all records from a table but unlike `DELETE`, it immediately deallocates the stored data's space and makes that space available to the database storage engine to reuse. It is faster than `DELETE` for removing large amounts of data but cannot be used if foreign keys are involved.\n",
            "- **DROP**: Removes both the data and the table definition from the database altogether.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 8. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?\n",
            "- **WHERE Clause**: Filters records on a per-row basis before any groupings are made.\n",
            "- **HAVING Clause**: Filters groups of rows returned by `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT`, after all rows have been grouped.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 9. Joins in SQL\n",
            "Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Types of joins include:\n",
            "- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records with matching values in both tables.\n",
            "- **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table.\n",
            "- **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table.\n",
            "- **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns matched records from both tables where there is a match or when there isn't a match in the other table.\n",
            "- **Self Join**: Occurs when a table joins to itself.\n",
            "- **Cross Join**: Produces a Cartesian product of the two tables involved in the join.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 10. Union and Union All\n",
            "- **UNION**: Combines the results of two queries into a single result set, eliminating duplicate values.\n",
            "- **UNION ALL**: Combines the results of two queries into a single result set, including all rows and duplicate values.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 11. Normalization and Denormalization\n",
            "- **Normalization**: The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n",
            "- **Denormalization**: The process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database for performance reasons.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 12. Difference between CHAR and VARCHAR\n",
            "- **CHAR**: A fixed-length string data type. It occupies the same amount of space irrespective of the length of characters stored.\n",
            "- **VARCHAR**: A variable-length string data type. It occupies only as much space as required to store the actual data.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 13. Difference between SQL and MySQL\n",
            "SQL is the standard language for relational databases, while MySQL is a specific RDBMS that implements SQL. MySQL is one of many database systems that use SQL.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 14. Auto Increment in SQL\n",
            "Auto Increment is a feature used to automatically generate a unique sequential number for a column whenever a new row is inserted into the table. It is often used as a primary key.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 15. What is Indexing?\n",
            "Indexing is the process of creating a data structure (typically a B-tree) that allows for quick retrieval of rows based on one or more columns of a database table.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 16. Clustered and Non-Clustered Index\n",
            "- **Clustered Index**: Determines the physical order of data in a table. There is only one clustered index per table.\n",
            "- **Non-Clustered Index**: Maintains a separate structure from the actual data rows and points to the location of the corresponding row in the table. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 17. What is View in SQL?\n",
            "A view is a virtual table based on a query. It contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 18. Difference between View and Table?\n",
            "- **View**: A saved query that provides a way to look at data as if it were a table, but it is not a separate object in the database's storage structure. It can be used to hide complexity, provide secure access to data, or combine data from multiple tables.\n",
            "- **Table**: A persistent storage structure that holds data. It exists in the database and can be directly queried, indexed, and so on.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 19. Stored Procedure\n",
            "A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements and functions that are stored under a name and can be called as needed. They can take and return data to and from the calling environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 20. Function\n",
            "A function in SQL is similar to a stored procedure, but it returns a single value or set of values (a result set). Functions can be scalar (returning one value) or tabular (returning a table).\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 21. Transaction Control Language (TCL)\n",
            "TCL commands manage transactions within the database to ensure data integrity and consistency in case of errors or system failures. They include `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 22. What is ACID in SQL?\n",
            "ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It ensures that database transactions are processed reliably, guaranteeing data integrity even in the event of system failures or other issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Advanced Features\n",
            "The guide above covers the basics of SQL. Beyond these fundamentals, there are many advanced features and topics to explore:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Complex Queries**: Using `JOIN`, `SUBQUERY`, `GROUP BY`, and window functions.\n",
            "- **Performance Tuning**: Indexing strategies, query optimization, and understanding execution plans.\n",
            "- **Security**: Implementing access control with roles and permissions.\n",
            "- **Data Integrity**: Constraints, triggers, and using views to maintain data consistency.\n",
            "- **Database Administration**: Backup and recovery, performance monitoring, and troubleshooting.\n",
            "- **Advanced Data Types**: Handling JSON, XML, and spatial data types.\n",
            "- **Reporting and Analytics**: Using SQL for complex reporting needs and analytical functions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Additional Resources\n",
            "To further your understanding of SQL, consider the following resources:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **SQL Reference Manuals**: Official documentation from database vendors like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQL Server.\n",
            "2. **Online Tutorials and Courses**: Websites like Coursera, edX, Codecademy, and Khan Academy offer free and paid courses on SQL.\n",

            "### 1. What is SQL?\n",
            "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It allows you to perform operations like querying, updating, and managing the schema of a database.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. What is a Database?\n",
            "A database is an organized collection of data structured into tables with rows and columns for easy access, modification, and management. Databases are central to many types of applications, from banking systems to search engines.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Types of SQL Commands\n",
            "- **Data Querying**: `SELECT`, `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`\n",
            "- **Data Manipulation**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`\n",
            "- **Data Definition**: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`\n",
            "- **Data Control**: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. What is the ACID Property in SQL?\n",
            "ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It ensures reliable processing of database transactions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. What is a Transaction in SQL?\n",
            "A transaction is a sequence of database operations that are treated as a single unit; it either completes entirely or does not execute at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. What is the difference between COMMIT and ROLLBACK?\n",
            "- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during a transaction.\n",
            "- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes all changes made during a transaction if something goes wrong.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 7. What is Savepoint in SQL?\n",
            "A savepoint marks a point of rollback within a transaction, allowing you to roll back part of the transaction but not the entire transaction.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 8. What is the difference between IN and EXISTS?\n",
            "- **IN**: Tests whether a value exists among a set of values.\n",
            "- **EXISTS**: Checks if at least one row exists that meets the specified conditions without retrieving those rows.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 9. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?\n",
            "- **DELETE**: Removes records from a table and keeps the table structure intact, which allows for possible rollback operations.\n",
            "- **TRUNCATE**: Quickly removes all records from a table and deallocates space, without keeping track of deleted rows or allowing for rollback.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 10. What is Index Fragmentation?\n",
            "Index fragmentation occurs when the data in an index is spread out across the storage medium in an inefficient manner due to updates and deletes over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 11. What is the difference between RANK() and DENSE_RANK()?\n",
            "- **RANK()**: Assigns a unique number to each row within a partition ordered by a specific column or expression, with gaps if there are ties.\n",
            "- **DENSE_RANK()**: Assigns a unique number to each distinct position in the sorted order without gaps for tied values.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 12. How to fetch common records from two tables?\n",
            "Use the `INTERSECT` or `EXCEPTION` operator, or write a query with a `JOIN` and a condition that filters for records present in both tables.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 13. What is the difference between UNION and JOIN?\n",
            "- **UNION**: Combines the result sets of two (or more) queries into a single result set, removing duplicates.\n",
            "- **JOIN**: Retrieves rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 14. What is Pivot Table in SQL?\n",
            "A pivot table in SQL transforms data from rows to columns (or vice versa), making it easier to analyze and report data. It's achieved using `PIVOT`, `CROSS TAB`, or a combination of aggregation functions like `SUM()` with `CASE`.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 15. What is Case Sensitivity in SQL?\n",
            "Case sensitivity varies by database system. In some, like MySQL, SQL keywords are not case-sensitive, but identifiers (table and column names) are. In others, like PostgreSQL, both keywords and identifiers can be case-sensitive.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 16. How to find the Nth Highest Salary?\n",
            "Use window functions like `DENSE_RANK()` or `ROW_NUMBER()` in combination with a subquery.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 17. How to get First 3 Maximum Salaries?\n",
            "Use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to retrieve the top N records based on a specific column.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 18. What is the difference between Drop, Delete, and Truncate?\n",
            "- **DROP**: Removes the table structure entirely.\n",
            "- **DELETE**: Removes records but preserves the table structure.\n",
            "- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all records and resets the identity column to its starting point.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 19. How to calculate Age from Date of Birth in SQL?\n",
            "Use date difference functions like `DATEDIFF()` or `EXTRACT()` along with `BIRTHDATE` and `GETDATE()` or current date.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 20. What is Recursive Query in SQL?\n",
            "A recursive query retrieves data that can be logically viewed as a series of related rows, often used in hierarchical data like organizational structures. It uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with the `WITH` clause.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 21. What is the difference between Temporary Table and CTE?\n",
            "- **Temporary Table**: A table that exists only for the duration of a session or a transaction, often used to store intermediate results.\n",
            "- **CTE**: A temporary result set that is referenced within a single query, which is not stored but defined in terms of the query itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 22. How to find Odd and Even records in SQL?\n",
            "Use the `MOD()` function to check for divisibility by 2, and filter accordingly.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 23. What is JSON in SQL?\n",
            "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. SQL databases can store and query JSON data using the `JSON` data type.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 24. What is XML in SQL?\n",
            "XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. SQL supports XML data types and operations for storing and querying XML data.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 25. How to handle NULL values in SQL?\n",
            "Use functions like `ISNULL()`, `COALESCE()`, or provide `DEFAULT` values in column definitions to deal with NULLs.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 26. What is Dynamic SQL?\n",
            "Dynamic SQL is SQL code that is constructed at runtime, often based on input parameters or conditions met during the execution of a program. It can be executed using dynamic SQL statement construction and the `EXECUTE` command.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 27. Can a Trigger Call Another Trigger in SQL?\n",
            "A trigger cannot directly call another trigger. However, one trigger can invoke an operation that in turn calls another trigger.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 28. What is Subquery?\n",
            "A subquery (also known as a nested query) is a query nested inside another query. It can be used to filter or compute values for the outer query.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 29. What is Nested Query?\n",
            "A nested query is a query within another query, where the inner query returns a single value that the outer query uses in its condition or calculation.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 30. What is Correlated Subquery?\n",
            "A correlated subquery correlates with each row processed by the outer query. It typically involves a `JOIN` operation between the outer query and the subquery, where the outer query uses values from the outer table to fetch corresponding values from the inner table.\n",
