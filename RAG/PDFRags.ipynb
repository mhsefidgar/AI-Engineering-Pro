The SQL CheatSheet provided by Deeplytic Technologies is a comprehensive guide for beginners looking to understand the fundamentals of SQL and its various commands, functions, and concepts. Below is a full tutorial based on the content of the cheatsheet, structured in an understandable manner:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Introduction to SQL and Databases\n",
            "- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: A standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.\n",
            "- **Databases**: Collections of data that are stored and accessed electronically. They allow for efficient data storage, retrieval, update, and management.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Basic SQL Commands\n",
            "1. **SELECT**: Retrieves data from one or more tables.\n",
            "   - Example: `SELECT * FROM Employees;`\n",
            "2. **INSERT**: Inserts new records into a table.\n",
            "3. **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in a table.\n",
            "4. **DELETE**: Removes records from a table.\n",
            "5. **DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE**: All delete data but differ in how they do it.\n",
            "   - **DROP**: Permanently removes the entire table.\n",
            "   - **TRUNCATE**: Removes all records but the table structure remains.\n",
            "   - **DELETE**: Removes specific records (can be retrieved).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Primary Key, Foreign Key, and UNIQUE Key\n",
            "- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table and ensures data integrity.\n",
            "- **Foreign Key**: Establishes a link between two tables to ensure referential integrity.\n",
            "- **UNIQUE Key**: Ensures that all values in a column are distinct, not necessarily as unique as a primary key.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Constraints\n",
            "- **NOT NULL Constraint**: Specifies that a column cannot have a NULL value.\n",
            "- **Default Constraint**: Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Data Manipulation and Retrieval\n",
            "1. **JOINs** (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN): Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.\n",
            "   - **INNER JOIN**: Returns records with matching values in both tables.\n",
            "   - **LEFT (RIGHT) JOIN**: Returns all records from the left (right) table, and matched records from the right (left) table.\n",
            "   - **FULL JOIN**: Returns all records from both tables, regardless of whether there is a match.\n",
            "2. **Self Join** and **Cross Join**:\n",
            "   - **Self Join**: A join between tables with the same name.\n",
            "   - **Cross Join** (also known as Cartesian Product): Produces a result set with all combinations of rows from two tables.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Set Operations\n",
            "- **UNION and UNION ALL**: Combine the results of two queries into a single result set.\n",
            "   - **UNION**: Removes duplicates.\n",
            "   - **UNION ALL**: Includes all results, including duplicates.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Aggregation Functions and Group By\n",
            "1. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.\n",
            "2. **Aggregate Functions** (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN): Perform a calculation on each group of rows.\n",
            "   - **ROWS_NUMBER()**, **RANK()**, and **DENSE_RANK()**: Assign a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition ordered by the specification.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Subqueries, Nested Queries, and Correlated Subqueries\n",
            "- **Subquery**: A query nested inside another query.\n",
            "- **Nested Query**: A subquery that is part of the WHERE clause of another query.\n",
            "- **Correlated Subquery**: A subquery that references a column from the outer query.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Window Functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK())\n",
            "- Used to perform calculations across a set of rows defined by an ORDER BY clause.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Case Statement, COALESCE, and NVL Function\n",
            "- **CASE Statement**: Evaluates a set of conditions and returns the value associated with the first condition that is true.\n",
            "- **COALESCE**: Returns the first not-NULL value from a list of arguments.\n",
            "- **NVL Function**: Returns the first not-NULL argument; if all arguments are NULL, it returns a specified default value.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Indexing (Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes)\n",
            "- **Indexing**: A method to find rows faster by using key columns to sort and store data.\n",
            "- **Clustered Index**: The database object that defines the physical order of data rows in a table.\n",
            "- **Non-Clustered Index**: Provides an additional, separate storage structure for the rows in a table, which can be used to quickly locate a specific row.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Views, Stored Procedures, Triggers, and Cursors\n",
            "1. **Views**: Virtual tables defined by a query that can be used for reporting and simplifying complex queries.\n",
            "2. **Stored Procedures**: Predefined collections of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit to encapsulate business logic or operations.\n",
            "3. **Triggers**: Automatically execute code (SQL statements) when certain events occur in the database.\n",
            "4. **Cursors**: A programming-like construct used to hold a set of rows selected from a table and process them row by row.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Transactions and ACID Properties\n",
            "- **Transactions**: A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.\n",
            "- **ACID Properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability): Ensuring the reliability of database transactions.\n",
            "   - **COMMIT**: Finalizes all changes made during transaction execution.\n",

This guide will cover various aspects of SQL, from basic concepts to advanced topics, including commands, functions, and operations. Each section will be explained in a clear and understandable manner.\n",

            "### Introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language)\n",
            "\n",
            "SQL is the standard language for managing and manipulating data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It allows you to perform tasks such as querying, updating, and maintaining database structures.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Basic Concepts\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Database**: A structured set of data held in a computer. Databases are organized so that data can be easily accessed, managed, and used by database systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Table**: The basic logical unit of data storage in a relational database. Tables consist of rows (records) and columns (attributes).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Primary Key**: A unique column or attribute that identifies each row uniquely in a table. No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Foreign Key**: A column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table, creating a link between the tables (relationship).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **UNIQUE Key**: A constraint that uniquely identifies each row in a table and allows for some duplicate values (but only one per table).\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **NOT NULL Constraint**: A constraint that specifies that a column cannot accept NULL values.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Default Constraint**: A constraint that assigns a default value to a column if no value is specified during data insertion.\n",
            "\n",
            "### SQL Commands and Operations\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Used to create, alter, or drop database objects like tables, indexes, etc.\n",
            "   - `CREATE TABLE`: Creates a new table in the database.\n",
            "   - `ALTER TABLE`: Modifies a table's definition.\n",
            "   - `DROP TABLE`: Removes a table and its data from the database.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Used to query, insert, update, or delete data in the database.\n",
            "   - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables.\n",
            "   - `INSERT INTO`: Inserts new data into a table.\n",
            "   - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing data in a table.\n",
            "   - `DELETE FROM`: Removes data from a table.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Used to control access to the database objects.\n",
            "   - `GRANT`: Grants permissions to users or roles.\n",
            "   - `REVOKE`: Revokes permissions from users or roles.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Joins and Subqueries\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Joins**: Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\n",
            "   - `INNER JOIN`: Returns rows when there is at least one match in both tables.\n",
            "   - `LEFT (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table(s). The result is NULL from the right side if there is no match.\n",
            "   - `RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table(s). The result is NULL from the left side if there is no match.\n",
            "   - `FULL (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables.\n",
            "   - `SELF JOIN`: A join where a table is joined with itself.\n",
            "   - `CROSS JOIN` (or Cartesian Product): Returns all combinations of rows from the two tables involved in the join.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Subqueries**: A query nested inside another query.\n",
            "   - `Correlated Subquery`: A subquery that references an outer query. It is executed repeatedly, once for each row retrieved by the outer query.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: A temporary result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Group By**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows like by counting, summing, averaging, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Having**: Filters groups based on criteria after a `GROUP BY` clause has been applied.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Functions and Aggregations\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Aggregate Functions**: Used to perform calculations across multiple rows that are grouped by one or more columns.\n",
            "   - `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`: Return the number, sum, average, minimum, and maximum of a column's values within each group, respectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Window Functions**: Perform calculations across a set of rows defined by the window definition.\n",
            "   - `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`: Assign a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition of a result set, sorted by the specified column(s).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **CASE Statement**: Performs a case analysis and returns different values based on conditions defined.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **COALESCE**: Returns the first non-NULL value from a list of values.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **NVL**: A legacy function that returns the first non-NULL value or a specified default if all values are NULL.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Indexing and Performance Optimization\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Indexing**: A technique to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure.\n",
            "   - `CREATE INDEX`: Creates a new index in the database.\n",
            "   - `DROP INDEX`: Removes an existing index from the database.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index**: A clustered index defines the physical order of data in a table, while a non-clustered index is a separate object that provides a logical ordering of rows to facilitate faster data retrieval.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Database Objects and Transactions\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **View**: A virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL query. It contains rows and columns, just like a real table.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Stored Procedure**: A set of SQL statements that can be executed as a unit. They are used to encapsulate multiple commands or complex queries.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Function**: Similar to a stored procedure but typically returns a single value or set of values.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Trigger**: Automatically executes a predefined T-SQL statement or batch when certain events occur in the database.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Cursor**: A database object that holds a set of rows selected by a query and allows you to process them one row at a time.\n",
            "\n",
            "### ACID Properties and Transactions\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **ACID**: Stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It ensures the integrity and reliability of database transactions.\n",
            "   - `COMMIT`: Saves all changes to the database permanently.\n",
            "   - `ROLLBACK`: Undoes all the changes made by a transaction.\n",
            "   - `Savepoint`: Marks a point in the current transaction that you can use to roll back to, within the same transaction.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Miscellaneous Operations\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Join vs Union**:\n",
            "   - `JOIN` combines rows from two tables where they have matching values.\n",
            "   - `UNION` combines the result sets of two queries into a single result set that contains all the rows from both queries, without duplicates.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Pivot Table**: Transforms data from rows to columns, which is useful for summarizing and reporting data in tabular form.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Case Sensitivity**: SQL is generally case-insensitive, but some functions (like `UPPER()` or `LOWER()`) can handle case sensitivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Data Types**: Understanding the different data types available for columns (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Constraints**: Ensuring data integrity through various constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "This guide covers a wide range of SQL concepts and operations. To become proficient in SQL, practice is essential. Experiment with the different commands on sample databases to understand how each command affects the database and the data within it. Additionally, always ensure that your practice sessions are conducted on non-production databases to prevent any unintended consequences."
