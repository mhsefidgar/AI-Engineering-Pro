            "### Index Fragmentation\n",
            "- A condition that occurs when the physical order of data in an index does not match its logical order.\n",

            "### Difference between Temporary Table and CTE\n",
            "- A temporary table exists independently of any query and can be referenced multiple times. A CTE is a named temporary result set that can only be referenced within the query that defines it.\n",
